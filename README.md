# cloud-itonami-isco-7531

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 7531**: Tailors, Dressmakers, Furriers and Hatters.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for a tailoring workshop scheduling and logistics coordination practice: a workshop scheduling and supply-coordination robot manages crew/task records under a governor-gated actor, so a tailoring, dressmaking, fur or millinery workshop crew keeps its own operating records instead of renting a closed workforce-management SaaS.

ISCO-08 7531 covers tailors, dressmakers, furriers and hatters: needle, cutting-tool (shears) and sewing-machine/equipment workshop hazards apply across all four, plus, for furriers specifically, material-provenance/handling considerations for pelt materials. This actor's scope and hazard reporting stay deliberately generic (needle-hazard / cutting-tool-hazard / equipment-condition) rather than technique-specific to any one of the four trades.

**Maturity: `:implemented`.** `src/stitchcoord/` implements the
`StitchCoordActor` as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
(`stitchcoord.actor`) wired to a `Stitch Coordination Advisor`
(`stitchcoord.advisor`) and an independent `StitchCoordGovernor`
(`stitchcoord.governor`), following the itonami actor pattern
(ADR-2607121000): `:intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit
(:ok?) +-> :request-approval (:escalate?, human-in-the-loop interrupt)
+-> :hold (:hard?)`. HARD invariants (always hold, never
overridable): artisan provenance, workshop provenance, no-actuation
(`:effect` must be `:propose`), a closed op-allowlist
(`:log-work-record`, `:schedule-crew-operation`,
`:flag-safety-concern`, `:coordinate-supply-order` — nothing else may
ever be proposed), and a permanent, unconditional block on any
proposal that would directly finalize a garment-construction-
execution decision (e.g. deciding a garment is finished) or a
workshop-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a workshop
safety-cleared), or override a shop safety officer's judgment.
Always-escalate paths (human sign-off regardless of confidence,
mapping this repo's Trust Controls in
[`docs/business-model.md`](docs/business-model.md)):
`:flag-safety-concern` (always) and `:coordinate-supply-order` above
the registered cost threshold.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a workshop scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling, job/commission/progress-record logging and fabric/pelt/millinery-materials supply-order coordination for a tailoring, dressmaking, fur or millinery workshop crew, under an actor that proposes actions and an independent **Stitch Coordination Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself, never performs garment-construction work on the shop floor, and never finalizes a garment-construction-execution decision or a workshop-safety-clearance decision, nor overrides a shop safety officer's judgment; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as a flagged needle-hazard/cutting-tool-hazard/equipment-condition concern, or an above-threshold supply order) require human sign-off. **This actor coordinates workshop scheduling/logistics only — it never performs garment-construction work or makes workshop-safety-clearance decisions itself.**

## Core Contract

```text
crew roster + workshop registration + safety-reporting policy
        |
        v
Stitch Coordination Advisor -> StitchCoordGovernor -> log/schedule/coordinate, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, finalize
a garment-construction-execution decision, declare a workshop safety-clearance,
override a shop safety officer's judgment, suppress an operating record, or
disclose sensitive data without governor approval and audit evidence.
